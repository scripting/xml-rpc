This specification documents the XML-RPC protocol implemented in <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/">UserLand Frontier</a> 5.1. 

For a non-technical explanation, see <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1998/07/14/xmlRpcForNewbies">XML-RPC for Newbies</a>. 

This page provides all the information that an implementor needs.

### Overview

XML-RPC is a Remote Procedure Calling protocol that works over the Internet.

An XML-RPC message is an HTTP-POST request. The body of the request is in XML. A procedure executes on the server and the value it returns is also formatted in XML.

Procedure parameters can be scalars, numbers, strings, dates, etc.; and can also be complex record and list structures.

### Request example

Here's an example of an XML-RPC request:

```xmlPOST /RPC2 HTTP/1.0User-Agent: Frontier/5.1.2 (WinNT)Host: betty.userland.comContent-Type: text/xmlContent-length: 181<?xml version="1.0"?><methodCall>	<methodName>examples.getStateName</methodName>	<params>		<param>			<value><i4>41</i4></value>			</param>		</params>	</methodCall>```

### Header requirements



The format of the URI in the first line of the header is not specified. For example, it could be empty, a single slash, if the server is only handling XML-RPC calls. However, if the server is handling a mix of incoming HTTP requests, we allow the URI to help route the request to the code that handles XML-RPC requests. (In the example, the URI is /RPC2, telling the server to route the request to the "RPC2" responder.)



A User-Agent and Host must be specified. 



The Content-Type is text/xml. 



The Content-Length must be specified and must be correct.



### Payload format



The payload is in XML, a single &lt;methodCall> structure.



The &lt;methodCall> must contain a &lt;methodName> sub-item, a string, containing the name of the method to be called. The string may only contain identifier characters, upper and lower-case A-Z, the numeric characters, 0-9, underscore, dot, colon and slash. It's entirely up to the server to decide how to interpret the characters in a methodName. 



For example, the methodName could be the name of a file containing a script that executes on an incoming request. It could be the name of a cell in a database table. Or it could be a path to a file contained within a hierarchy of folders and files.



If the procedure call has parameters, the &lt;methodCall> must contain a &lt;params> sub-item. The &lt;params> sub-item can contain any number of &lt;param>s, each of which has a &lt;value>. 



### <a name="scalars">Scalar &lt;value>s</a>



&lt;value>s can be scalars, type is indicated by nesting the value inside one of the tags listed in this table:



<table cellspacing=3 border=0>

<tr><td valign="top"><b>Tag</b></td><td valign="top" width="35%"><b>Type</b></td><td valign="top"><b>Example</b></td></tr>



<tr><td valign="top">&lt;i4> or &lt;int></td><td valign="top" width="35%">four-byte signed integer</td><td valign="top">-12</td></tr>



<tr><td valign="top">&lt;boolean></td><td valign="top">0 (false) or 1 (true)</td><td valign="top">1</td></tr>



<tr><td valign="top">&lt;string></td><td valign="top">string</td><td valign="top">hello world</td></tr>



<tr><td valign="top">&lt;double></td><td valign="top">double-precision signed floating point number</td><td valign="top">-12.214</td></tr>



<tr><td valign="top">&lt;dateTime.iso8601></td><td valign="top">date/time</td><td valign="top">19980717T14:08:55</td></tr>



<tr><td valign="top">&lt;base64></td><td valign="top">base64-encoded binary</td><td valign="top">eW91IGNhbid0IHJlYWQgdGhpcyE=</td></tr>

</table>



If no type is indicated, the type is string.



### &lt;struct>s

A value can also be of type &lt;struct>.

A &lt;struct> contains &lt;member>s and each &lt;member> contains a &lt;name> and a &lt;value>. 

Here's an example of a two-element &lt;struct>:

```xml<struct>	<member>		<name>lowerBound</name>		<value><i4>18</i4></value>		</member>	<member>		<name>upperBound</name>		<value><i4>139</i4></value>		</member>	</struct>```

&lt;struct>s can be recursive, any &lt;value> may contain a &lt;struct> or any other type, including an &lt;array>, described below.

### &lt;array>s

A value can also be of type &lt;array>.

An &lt;array> contains a single &lt;data> element, which can contain any number of &lt;value>s.

Here's an example of a four-element array:

```xml<array>	<data>		<value><i4>12</i4></value>		<value><string>Egypt</string></value>		<value><boolean>0</boolean></value>		<value><i4>-31</i4></value>		</data>	</array>```

&lt;array> elements do not have names. 

You can mix types as the example above illustrates.

&lt;arrays>s can be recursive, any value may contain an &lt;array> or any other type, including a &lt;struct>, described above.

### Response example

Here's an example of a response to an XML-RPC request:

```xmlHTTP/1.1 200 OKConnection: closeContent-Length: 158Content-Type: text/xmlDate: Fri, 17 Jul 1998 19:55:08 GMTServer: UserLand Frontier/5.1.2-WinNT<?xml version="1.0"?><methodResponse>	<params>		<param>			<value><string>South Dakota</string></value>			</param>		</params>	</methodResponse>``` 

### Response format

Unless there's a lower-level error, always return 200 OK.

The Content-Type is text/xml. Content-Length must be present and correct.

The body of the response is a single XML structure, a &lt;methodResponse>, which can contain a single &lt;params> which contains a single &lt;param> which contains a single &lt;value>.

<a name="faults"></a>The &lt;methodResponse> could also contain a &lt;fault> which contains a &lt;value> which is a &lt;struct> containing two elements, one named &lt;faultCode>, an &lt;int> and one named &lt;faultString>, a &lt;string>.

A &lt;methodResponse> can not contain both a &lt;fault> and a &lt;params>.

### Fault example

```xmlHTTP/1.1 200 OKConnection: closeContent-Length: 426Content-Type: text/xmlDate: Fri, 17 Jul 1998 19:55:02 GMTServer: UserLand Frontier/5.1.2-WinNT<?xml version="1.0"?><methodResponse>	<fault>		<value>			<struct>				<member>					<name>faultCode</name>					<value><int>4</int></value>					</member>				<member>					<name>faultString</name>					<value><string>Too many parameters.</string></value>					</member>				</struct>			</value>		</fault>	</methodResponse>```

### <a name="goals">Strategies/Goals</a>



<i>Firewalls.</i> The goal of this protocol is to lay a compatible foundation across different environments, no new power is provided beyond the capabilities of the CGI interface. Firewall software can watch for POSTs whose Content-Type is text/xml. 



<i>Discoverability.</i> We wanted a clean, extensible format that's very simple. It should be possible for an HTML coder to be able to look at a file containing an XML-RPC procedure call, understand what it's doing, and be able to modify it and have it work on the first or second try. 



<i>Easy to implement.</i> We also wanted it to be an easy to implement protocol that could quickly be adapted to run in other environments or on other operating systems.



### <a name="update1">Updated 1/21/99 DW</a>

The following questions came up on the UserLand <a href="http://discuss.userland.com/">discussion group</a> as XML-RPC was being implemented in Python. <ul>

<li>The Response Format section says "The body of the response is a single XML structure, a &lt;methodResponse>, which <i>can</i> contain a single &lt;params>..." This is confusing. Can we leave out the  &lt;params>?

No you cannot leave it out if the procedure executed successfully. There are only two options, either a response contains a &lt;params> structure or it contains a &lt;fault> structure. That's why we used the word "can" in that sentence.

<li>Is "boolean" a distinct data type, or can boolean values be interchanged with integers (e.g. zero=false, non-zero=true)? 

Yes, boolean is a distinct data type. Some languages/environments allow for an easy coercion from zero to false and one to true, but if you mean true, send a boolean type with the value true, so your intent can't possibly be misunderstood.

<li>What is the legal syntax (and range) for integers? How to deal with leading zeros? Is a leading plus sign allowed? How to deal with whitespace? 

An integer is a 32-bit signed number. You can include a plus or minus at the beginning of a string of numeric characters. Leading zeros are collapsed. Whitespace is not permitted. Just numeric characters preceeded by a plus or minus.

<li>What is the legal syntax (and range) for floating point values (doubles)? How is the exponent represented? How to deal with whitespace? Can infinity and "not a number" be represented? 

There is no representation for infinity or negative infinity or "not a number". At this time, only decimal point notation is allowed, a plus or a minus, followed by any number of numeric characters, followed by a period and any number of numeric characters. Whitespace is not allowed. The range of allowable values is implementation-dependent, is not specified.

<li>What characters are allowed in strings? Non-printable characters? Null characters? Can a "string" be used to hold an arbitrary chunk of binary data? 

Any characters are allowed in a string except &lt; and &, which are encoded as &amp;lt; and &amp;amp;. A string can be used to encode binary data.

<li>Does the "struct" element keep the order of keys. Or in other words, is the struct "foo=1, bar=2" equivalent to "bar=2, foo=1" or not? 

The struct element does not preserve the order of the keys. The two structs are equivalent.

<li>Can the &lt;fault> struct contain other members than &lt;faultCode> and &lt;faultString>? Is there a global list of faultCodes? (so they can be mapped to distinct exceptions for languages like Python and Java)? 

A &lt;fault> struct <b>may not</b> contain members other than those specified. This is true for all other structures. We believe the specification is flexible enough so that all reasonable data-transfer needs can be accomodated within the specified structures. If you believe strongly that this is not true, please post a message on the discussion group.

There is no global list of fault codes. It is up to the server implementer, or higher-level standards to specify fault codes.

<li>What timezone should be assumed for the dateTime.iso8601 type? UTC? localtime? 

Don't assume a timezone. It should be specified by the server in its documentation what assumptions it makes about timezones.

</ul>
